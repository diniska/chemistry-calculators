README for all the calcs:

What is this:
	Whenever I need to write a small script to do something in the lab I will add it to this repository.
	
Note:
	Most of these are written in Python, but I may throw some JavaScript stuff up here also. 
	Occassionally I will write something in C++ and throw it up here also
